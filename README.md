[00:41.06] Hey yo step back, my voice hit the track
[00:43.91] And it's back putting hack on the map
[00:45.78] And it's about that time to come correct with the rhyme
[00:48.07] Get your feathers and climb to make the ladies feel fine
[00:50.59] We shine like sunlight and make the beat run right
[00:52.81] Making you rock like you only got one life
[00:55.40] Left to feel this, stepping with the realness
[00:57.62] We deal this now it's all about the illness
[00:59.79] Half-stepping, never that, we roll properly
[01:01.96] A couple hundred bucks past go just like Monopoly
[01:04.22] We full flash working this game like professionals
[01:06.63] Lyrically put me to work, my feet sessional
[01:09.15] I got you open while you digest my sound
[01:11.20] Bugging out while you watch my record spin around

[02:04.14] We never ever came to do this on some quick shh
[02:06.48] But when we do you know we guaranteed to rip shh
[02:08.74] We make the loud rap cats stay quiet
